Predicting an Employee’s wage – A comparison between Logistic Regression and Neural Networks

The aim of this project is to predict whether a given employee’s salary will be lesser than or greater
that 50K. A given person’s salary depends on various factor’s such as his location, educational
qualification, age., The project uses two models, namely Logistic Regression and Neural Networks
to classify the data (Adult data set) and use them to predict the salary of a new employee. The
report provides a comparative study of the results. This project is completed using R.

This project is carried out in three phases, Data collection, Model Fitting and prediction. Data
collection uses the “adult” dataset. Following this phase, the models are trained to learn from the
data provided. In the prediction phase, test data is tested against the two models.

This project uses the Adult dataset to train its models. “Adult” Dataset, also known as “Census
Income” dataset. This data was extracted from the census bureau database found at
http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/DES/www/welcome.html.


Data is read from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data. The
data set holds the following variables.

The project uses 70% of the total number of observations for training purposes and the remaining
30% to test the data.

Logistic Regression ~ 85 %
Neural Network ~ 88 %
